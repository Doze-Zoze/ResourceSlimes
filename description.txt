Resource Slimes is a quality-of-life mod intended to aid with resource gathering and reducing grindiness.
Supports Calamity

Currently adds 3 slimes to aid in getting ores, basic crafting and building materials, and travelling merchant loot.
Additionally, there is one miniboss which provides access to creating boss spawners. (Calamity boss spawners support is forthcoming)
